  <h2>About Tim Berners-Lee: </h2> 
  <p  style="text-align: justify;">Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee also known as TimBL, is an English computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, the HTML markup language, the URL system, and HTTP. He is a professorial research fellow at the University of Oxford[2] and a professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[3][4]
Berners-Lee proposed an information management system on 12 March 1989[5][6] and implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet in mid-November.[7][8][9][10][11] He devised and implemented the first Web browser and Web server and helped foster the Web's subsequent explosive development.</p>
<h2>Early life</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; background-color: brown;" >Berners-Lee was born in London on 8 June 1955,[24] the son of mathematicians and computer scientists Mary Lee Woods (1924–2017) and Conway Berners-Lee (1921–2019). His parents were both from Birmingham and worked on the Ferranti Mark 1, the first commercially-built computer. He has three younger siblings; his brother, Mike, is a professor of ecology and climate change management.

    Berners-Lee attended Sheen Mount Primary School, then attended Emanuel School (a direct grant grammar school at the time) from 1969 to 1973.[1][20] A keen trainspotter as a child, he learnt about electronics from tinkering with a model railway.[25]
    
    From 1973 to 1976, he studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA in physics.[1][24] While there, he made a computer out of an old television set he had purchased from a repair shop.[26]</p>
